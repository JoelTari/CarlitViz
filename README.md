# CarlitViz

A web-based visualization system of graphical models to represent the structure
of back-end SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping) applications.
Currently, it focuses on Causal Bayesian Networks and trees of cliques (a.k.a.
junction trees) using [D3js](d3js.org). 

Causal Graphs are an upcoming feature for the CARLIT system (Causal Approach To
Represent Localization and Internalized Topography).
